making my own personal site with github pages and jekyll

Hello, Ana here!

This is my first attempt at understanding Github Pages and Jekyll with Hank Quinlan's tutorial: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

I am making my own personal web page, and hopefully something that will turn into a customized page I designed with Git.
